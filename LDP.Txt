#How to change color of the text in the HTML without using CSS.?

HTML has a limited number of ways to add color without using CSS. Here are a few options:
Text Color: You can change the color of text using the "color" attribute in the "font" tag. For example:
<font color="red">This text is red</font>
Background Color: You can change the background color of an element using the "bgcolor" attribute. For example:
<body bgcolor="yellow">
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is some text</p>
</body>
Note:-that the "bgcolor" attribute is deprecated in HTML5, so it's recommended to use CSS instead.
Table Cell Background Color: You can change the background color of a table cell using the "bgcolor" attribute in the "td" tag. For example:
<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="green">Cell 1</td>
<td bgcolor="blue">Cell 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
Note that the "bgcolor" attribute is also deprecated in HTML5, so it's recommended to use CSS instead.
